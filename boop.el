;;; Commentary:
;; A plugin which can be used to monitor services or endpoints and
;; give you live reports (in the form of coloured characters) of the
;; status of that thing

;; It does this by asynchronously running scripts and mapping the exit
;; codes to colours

;;; Code:

;; TODO: Add in validation that `boop-plugins-dir` exists
;; TODO: Make the strategy stuff work
